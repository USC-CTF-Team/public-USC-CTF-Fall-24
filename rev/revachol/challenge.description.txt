There is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness. 
Your conscience ferments in it -- no larger than a single grain of malt.

All recollection of the person you are, the people in your life and 
even the world you're in has drowned in a sea of binary code.
This was no mere night of coding, it was a deluge.
Of world-ending proportions.

"Wait, shouldn't I have a flag or something?" (Check your pockets.)
