## Solution

There are a few ways to solve this. Easiest would be to put the image into Google Lens, or similar. 

The first result for Google Lens (on my device, at least), gives the name of the church in the TV show, "The Radiant Assembly of God": https://perrymason.fandom.com/wiki/Radiant_Assembly_of_God

A Google search for "The Radiant Assembly of God filming location" returns this site, which notes that the exterior scenes were filmed at the Art of Living Center (formerly the Second Church of Christ, Scientist) on West Adams Blvd: https://jhgraham.com/2020/10/13/perry-mason-2020/

Searching the name of the building returns a Wikipedia page that lists the architect: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Church_of_Christ,\_Scientist_(Los_Angeles)
