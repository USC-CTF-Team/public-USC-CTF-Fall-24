Title: 
TommyCam

Challenge Description:
In May of 1995, university staff members completed what would become a quirky, well-enjoyed campus feature - TommyCam! The 24/7 live video feed of our unofficial mascot's statue, Tommy Trojan, is still going strong almost 30 years later.

The site usc.edu was first archived by the Internet Archive in December 1996. At that time, the site included the technical specs for TommyCam. What PC was initially used to run TommyCam?

Answers should be formatted like this, for example: CYBORG{ThinkPad T480}
