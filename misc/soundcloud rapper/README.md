## Step 1
Listen to the mp4 and realize that the notes are storing some sort of message

## Step 2
Translate the .mp4 into notes. Either do this by ear, by tuner, or by a midi translator. On the treble clef the first sound of the song is all the notes

-F-
 E
-D-
 C
-B-
 A 
-G-
 F
-E-

## Step 3
Translate the pitches into numbers
- F = 8
- E = 7
- D = 6
- C = 5
- B = 4
- A = 3
- G = 2
- F = 1
- E = 0

## Step 4
